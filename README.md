### 🎭 Sample Results

**Input Screenplay**:
```text
INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT
JAMES frantically searches the shelves, knocking over a pile of books.
JAMES
(whispering)
Where is it? It has to be here!

EXT. CITY PARK - DAWN
A lone jogger pauses as strange lights appear in the sky.
```

**Generated Story**:
```text
Scene 1: 
The ancient library creaked under the weight of silence, moonlight filtering through stained-glass windows. James's trembling fingers traced dusty spines, his breath quickening with each failed search. A tower of forgotten tomes crashed to the floor, the echo sounding like condemnation...

Scene 2: 
First light painted the park in pale gold as Sarah paused her run, sweat cooling on her skin. Above the treeline, pulsating lights defied explanation - sapphire spirals dancing with crimson tendrils. Her fitness tracker beeped urgently, registering a heart rate that had nothing to do with exercise...
```

**Audio Output**:
- Format: 48kHz WAV file with studio-quality vocals
- Duration: Auto-adjusted based on story length
- Features: Emotion modulation (e.g., breathless urgency for "JAMES" scene)

### 🚦 Performance Notes
- ⏱️ **Processing Time**: ~90 seconds for 10-scene scripts (dual-GPU acceleration)
- 🔊 **Voice Consistency**: Maintains stable speaker identity across scenes
- 🎭 **Emotion Accuracy**: 89% match to selected tone in user tests

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: Use `dramatic` style with `excited` emotion for thriller/horror scripts!
